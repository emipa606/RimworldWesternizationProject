Update of Tamias and JackeryFoxs mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1119081000

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md).**
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the new version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3498164561).
This version will not receive any further updates.

- Added the CE patch to the mod, will load if CE is active
- Works well with [Steam World (Continued)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238859064)

Load order: Just use the auto-sort and it should be fine
